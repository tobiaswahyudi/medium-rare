# MediumWell

MediumWell is a rich-text editor webapp, built using Angular, Firebase, and the medium-editor library.

## Intro
This project was created for an internship take-home assessment.

Over the course of 3 days, I developed this app, starting with zero knowledge of angular and little experience with firebase. This project motivated me to broaden my skills and pick up new (old?) technologies.

## Tools / Resources
- Angular
- Firebase
- RxJS
- [Medium-Editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor)
- Github Actions as CI
- [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
